            <h2>Here's a Time line of Tony Stark</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1970</strong> - Tony Stark is born to industrialist Howard Stark and socialite Maria Stark.
                    He quickly displays an extraordinary genius, particularly in engineering.</li>

                <li><strong>1991</strong> - His parents are tragically killed in a car crash, later revealed to be an
                    assassination by the Winter Soldier. Tony, still very young, inherits Stark Industries and its vast
                    wealth.</li>

                <li><strong>2008</strong> - Tony is captured by terrorists in Afghanistan and suffers a critical injury.
                    He builds a rudimentary armored suit to escape, marking the birth of Iron Man and his public reveal.
                </li>

                <li><strong>2010</strong> - Grappling with public and government pressure to share his technology, Tony
                    faces a vengeful enemy with a connection to his father. He overcomes a personal crisis and further
                    develops his Iron Man capabilities.</li>

                <li><strong>2012</strong> - Tony joins Earth's mightiest heroes, the Avengers, to defend New York City
                    from an alien invasion. This event deeply impacts his worldview, causing him to grapple with new,
                    larger threats.</li>

                <li><strong>2013</strong> - Suffering from PTSD after the alien invasion, Tony builds an army of Iron
                    Man suits. He confronts a new terrorist threat while also undergoing a personal journey of
                    self-discovery.</li>

                <li><strong>2015</strong> - Driven by a desire to protect the world, Tony creates an artificial
                    intelligence, Ultron, which unexpectedly turns rogue. This leads to a global conflict and further
                    strains the Avengers' cohesion.</li>

                <li><strong>2016</strong> - Tony aligns with the Sokovia Accords, believing in government oversight for
                    enhanced individuals, leading to a profound ideological clash with Captain America. He also begins
                    to mentor Peter Parker, a young hero with spider-like abilities.</li>

                <li><strong>2018</strong> - Tony faces his greatest challenge yet in Thanos, a cosmic warlord aiming to
                    wipe out half of all life. Despite his best efforts, Tony is among the billions who vanish in
                    Thanos's devastating snap.</li>

                <li><strong>2023</strong> - After five years, Tony, having survived the snap and built a family, devises
                    a way to reverse Thanos's actions through time travel. In a final act of ultimate self-sacrifice, he
                    wields the Infinity Stones to defeat Thanos, giving his life to save the universe.</li>
